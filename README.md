## About

**Flutters** is a demo game powered by [Flutter](https://www.flutter.dev) and [Flame](https://flame-engine.org/). I wrote it to test out its performance and gaming capabilities and decided to open source it, so you can learn to _flutter_ aswell.

### Why is a Flutter Game awesome?

- Apps run on iOS and Android
- Awesome hot-reloading
- Compiles to native
- It is simple to learn
